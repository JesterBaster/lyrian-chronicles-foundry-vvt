# Generated compendium content

These JSON files are deterministic Foundry document sources compiled from the approved Angel's Sword rulebook v0.13.2 snapshot in `content-source/approved/0.13.2/`.

`compendium-index.json` tells the runtime which chunks belong to each pack. Run `node tools/build-compendiums.mjs` to rebuild the files. Do not hand-edit generated JSON. Every document has a deterministic 16-character ID, stable seed key, source URL, normalized source hash, and rulebook version.

## Updating to a new rulebook version

The snapshot in `content-source/approved/` is the reviewed source; `content/` is
compiled from it. A newer capture is **merged onto** the approved one rather than
replacing it, because a snapshot read from the site's rendered pages carries the
new entries and the real rules edits but cannot see everything the approved copy
already holds:

```
node tools/merge-rulebook-snapshot.mjs \
  content-source/approved/<previous> <new-snapshot.json> <out-dir> --report
node tools/split-approved-snapshot.mjs <out-dir>/snapshot.json content-source/approved/<new>
node tools/build-compendiums.mjs
```

`--report` prints exactly which fields the merge took from the incoming snapshot,
and `tests/rulebook-merge.test.mjs` pins every rule about what it refuses.

**Check tier and difficulty by hand.** They are drawn on the site as filled pip
glyphs rather than numbers, so a capture has to count them and can be wrong
without looking wrong: the 0.13.2 capture returned one constant for all 185
classes. The merge protects those two fields, so only classes new in the update
are exposed. `tests/class-tier-difficulty.test.mjs` pins all 185 against
`tests/fixtures/class-tier-difficulty-<version>.json`; refresh that fixture from
the site on each update, and re-run it — a correct count reproduces every
pre-existing class exactly, which is what makes the new ones trustworthy. Then
update `EXPECTED`, the `SOURCE` default and the version guard in
`tools/build-compendiums.mjs`, and `CONTENT_VERSION` in
`module/content/seed-packs.mjs` so existing worlds re-seed.

The old mixed item pack and prototype JSON files were removed during the testing phase.

The Mods pack contains 93 universal mods and 298 reviewed item-specific mods from the Weapons, Armors, and Artifices tabs. Three Anti-Air Weapon Sight mods remain excluded because their crafting-point costs are blank in the source sheet.
