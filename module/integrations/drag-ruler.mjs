 * full move, and one with AP left is not shown the second and third moves they
 * can pay for.

 * Registered through `dragRuler.registerSystem`, the system-side half of the
 * API — `registerModule` is for companion packages.

 * band rather than none at all: Drag Ruler reads an empty list as "no limit",
 * which would draw an out-of-AP token as free to run.
